So I decided to start a blog. I wanted something simple - just markdown. At first I thought I could just put posts in a git repo like [this guy](https://github.com/pretzelhammer/rust-blog/tree/master). Well I guess I also want a bit more than that. 

[GitHub Pages With Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) seemed perfect, but everything keep coming back to having to do a lot of reading to understand all of the configuration. So I packaged all of that into a simple GitHub template called [Easy GitHub Blog](https://github.com/gringasalpastor/easy-github-blog) so that the next person can just get right to writing markdown.
